# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot
## HARDWARE:
> :: Arduino NANO <
:: Servo
:: Ultrasonic Sensor
:: L293d Motor Chip
:: 2 Dc Motors
:: Breadboard
Working:
The robots starts moving forward once it is powered it stop if the distance infornt of it is < 800 sensor value Whick is almost 1 meter,It stop and the servo turns the senor left and takes the distance on left then turns right and takes the distance on right It then Compares the Distance Left and Distance right if the distance on eft is greater then right it turns left otherwise it turns right.
If the robot stop and takes both distances on left and right and both are less than 800 it stops there and program ends.
